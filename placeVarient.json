        "en-US": "The Eiffel Tower, an iconic symbol of Paris and a masterpiece of architectural brilliance, rises gracefully above the city skyline. Standing at 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, this iron lattice tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair), celebrating the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Its intricate framework, composed of over 18,000 iron parts and held together by 2.5 million rivets, showcases both strength and elegance.\n\nBy day, the tower glimmers under the Parisian sun, offering breathtaking panoramic views from its observation decks. By night, it transforms into a dazzling spectacle with thousands of golden lights and a sparkling show that illuminates the city every hour. Whether admired from afar or experienced up close, the Eiffel Tower embodies the romance, innovation, and timeless charm of \"La Ville Lumière\"—the City of Light."
